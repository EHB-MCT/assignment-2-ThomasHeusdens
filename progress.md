## **Day 2**

- **Task**: Enhanced the `CoursePage` for displaying individual course units.
  - Created `CourseSidebar` and `UnitViewer` components to modularize the `CoursePage`.
  - Implemented a `CoursePage` layout with a sidebar for units and a viewer for detailed unit content.
  - Added navigation to the `UnitViewer` for switching between units dynamically.
  - Designed a responsive layout with CSS:
    - Sidebar (`unitsSideBar`) displays a list of units.
    - Viewer (`unitViewer`) displays unit details, including optional video content.
    - Added hover effects and ensured the layout adapts well to various screen sizes.
  - Tested functionality using sample JSON data for units.

- **Task**: Updated the backend to support unit data.
  - Created a `Unit` schema in `models/Unit.js` to store detailed unit information.
  - Added an API route in `routes/unitRoutes.js` to fetch units by `courseId`.
  - Updated `server.js` to include the `unitRoutes` API endpoint.
  - Tested backend API using Postman, ensured units were fetched correctly.

- **Task**: Populated the database with units.
  - Generated and imported JSON data for 8 courses, each with 4 units.
  - Ensured units have diverse attributes, including optional videos.
  - Ran a script to convert `courseId` fields in the database to `ObjectId` for consistency.

- **Task**: Improved UI for navigation and user experience.
  - Added a clickable "X" button to exit the `CoursePage` and navigate back to the homepage.
  - Styled the "X" button for consistent design, including hover effects and responsiveness.
  - Ensured all components align with the design of the `Home` page.

- **Task**: Refactored the `Home` component.
  - Moved the `courses` rendering logic into a new `Courses` component for better modularity.
  - Updated `Home.js` to focus on fetching and passing data to the `Courses` component.
  - Simplified `Home.js` and added detailed function comments for clarity.

- **Outcome**: Fully functional `CoursePage` with a sidebar and detailed unit viewer. Backend supports unit data and retrieves units dynamically based on `courseId`. Database populated with rich sample data for courses and units. Frontend components are modular and well-documented, improving code readability. Navigation between pages and units works seamlessly. Code is clean, modular, and well-documented, ensuring maintainability. All changes are successfully merged into the `main` branch.

## **Day 3**

- **Task**: Added user authentication functionality.
  - Integrated **JWT-based authentication** in the backend.
    - Set up `authRoutes.js` to handle `register`, `login`, and `logout` requests.
    - Used `bcrypt` for password hashing and `jsonwebtoken` for generating JWT tokens.
    - Created a `User` schema in `models/User.js` to store user credentials, subscription types, and registration dates.
  - Implemented middleware to verify JWT tokens and handle secure routes.
  - Ensured the backend API supports error handling for invalid credentials and missing fields.

- **Task**: Created authentication pages on the frontend.
  - Built `Login` and `Register` pages with forms for user credentials.
  - Integrated user authentication into the `Home` page.
    - Checked token validity on page load to update login status.
    - Added dynamic buttons for `Login`, `Register`, and `Logout` based on authentication state.
  - Added logout functionality:
    - Sent logout requests to the backend to invalidate tokens.
    - Removed tokens from `localStorage` and updated state on successful logout.
  - Styled forms and buttons to align with the overall project design.

- **Task**: Implemented user activity tracking.
  - Created a `UserActivity` schema in `models/UserActivity.js` to log viewed units.
  - Built a backend route (`userActivityRoutes.js`) to:
    - Save viewed units for a specific user.
    - Prevent duplicates by checking if a unit is already logged.
    - Retrieve all units a user has viewed for a specific course.
  - Integrated activity tracking in the frontend:
    - Automatically logged the first unit of a course when opened.
    - Logged additional units dynamically when the user navigated through the course.
    - Displayed a checkmark (`âœ“`) in the `UnitsSidebar` for viewed units.

- **Task**: Displayed user progress on the homepage.
  - Enhanced the `Home` page to calculate and display course progress.
    - Fetched all units for each course from the backend.
    - Retrieved viewed units for the logged-in user using the activity API.
    - Calculated progress as a percentage (`viewedUnits / totalUnits * 100`).
  - Updated the `Courses` component to show progress under each course description:
    - Example: `Course done: 50%`.
  - Styled progress indicators to match the design.

- **Task**: Improved backend reliability and database consistency.
  - Ensured duplicate entries are avoided when logging unit views.
  - Added API endpoints to check if a unit is already logged before saving it.
  - Resolved merge conflicts in the `feature/track-user-activity` branch and ensured functionality after merging with `main`.

- **Task**: Cleaned up and refactored the project.
  - Consolidated repetitive logic into reusable functions for the backend.
  - Added comments and documentation to all new code for better readability.
  - Squashed multiple commits into a single commit during Git rebase for a cleaner history.
  - Pushed all changes to the `main` branch with a meaningful commit message.

- **Outcome**: Fully functional authentication system with user activity tracking and progress display. Users can log in, register, and see their progress for each course on the homepage. The backend reliably tracks viewed units without duplicates. The frontend dynamically updates viewed units and progress, providing a seamless experience. Codebase is clean, modular, and well-documented. All changes are successfully merged into the `main` branch.

## **Day 4**

- **Task**: Implemented user behavior tracking.

  - Added a feature to track how much time a user spends on a unit page.
  - Created a new UserBehavior schema in models/UserBehavior.js to log user interactions:
    - Fields include userId, courseId, unitId, timeSpent, videoIncluded, and date.
  - Built a backend API endpoint (userBehaviorRoutes.js) to:
    - Log the time spent on a unit page.
    - Include a flag (videoIncluded) to indicate whether the unit contains a video.
    - Ensure proper error handling and data validation.
  - Integrated behavior tracking into the frontend:
    - Started a timer when the user enters a unit.
    - Logged the total time spent when the user leaves the unit or navigates away.
    - Prevented duplicate entries by using useRef to manage logging state.

- **Outcome**: Fully functional user behavior tracking for unit pages. Accurate logging of time spent, with duplicate entries and premature logs eliminated. Backend and frontend are seamlessly integrated to handle behavior tracking. Code is clean, modular, and well-documented, ensuring maintainability. All changes are successfully merged into the `main` branch.
