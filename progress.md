  - Refracted every UserBehavior to UserTimeSpent.
  - Updated the `/time-spent` endpoint to check if an entry already exists for a specific user, course, and unit. If found, the `timeSpent` is added to the existing value; otherwise, a new entry is created.
  - Modified the `UserScrollPercentage` schema and related endpoints to include a `videoIncluded` field to track whether the unit contains a video.

- **Task**: Improved Scroll Tracking
  - Ensured that only the highest scroll percentage is logged when leaving a unit or switching units, with redundant entries being deleted from the database.
  - Implemented a fix to reset the scroll position to the top of the page when navigating to a new unit.

- **Task**: Code Optimization:
  - Simplified and documented key functions, ensuring maintainability and readability.
  - Enhanced cleanup logic for tracking and logging user behavior to prevent unnecessary database writes.

- **Outcome**: The scroll tracking was refined to ensure that only the highest scroll percentage is logged when leaving a unit, with redundant entries being deleted, and the page now resets to the top when navigating to a new unit. For time tracking, the /time-spent endpoint was updated to add new time spent to existing entries for a user, course, and unit instead of creating duplicates. These changes optimize data accuracy and enhance the user behavior tracking system. Code is clean, modular, and well-documented, ensuring maintainability. All changes are successfully merged into the `main` branch.
